This repository contains a bunch of useful (to me anyway) scripts for interacting with Boulder Real Time Technologies (BRTT) Antelope Environmental Monitoring System. The scripts are predominantly in Python, but I plan on adding other languages too.

If you have any questions about this repository, give me a holler on GitHub.
