# Introduction
This repository contains a bunch of useful (to me anyway) scripts
for interacting with Boulder Real Time Technologies (BRTT) Antelope
Environmental Monitoring System. The scripts are predominantly in
Python, but I plan on adding other languages too.

# Caveats
Most of the scripts require you to have installed Antelope, the
Antelope Interface to Python (which comes pre-built and ships with
Antelope as of 5.2-64). Python 2.6 and up.

# Feedback
If you have any questions about this repository, give me a holler on GitHub.
